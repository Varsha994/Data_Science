On December 31, 2019, China reported a new virus to the World Health Organization (WHO), which later came to be known as COVID-19 -- the “CO” stands for coronavirus, “VI” for virus and “D” for disease. The coronavirus itself is called “nCoV-2019”. The virus, which causes symptoms ranging from an itchy throat to pneumonia, has killed thousands globally and infected millions. Several countries, including India, have implemented lockdown measures and other restrictions in a bid to stop the tranmission of the coronavirus. There are global efforts to find a cure or vaccine for the coronavirus, with several studies underway and in different stages of development. Scientists are also trying to understand the origin of the virus and how it is transmitted.
